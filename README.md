Hey there ðŸ‘‹,

I am a **Data Scientist at Artefact**, specializing in optimization, marketing modeling methods, regression models, classification models, and large language models (LLMs) across various industries, particularly in the beverage and food sectors. 

I have a **Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of SÃ£o Paulo (USP)**, focusing on complex networks classification and modeling. 

In addition to my industry work, I am a  **professor at the University of Aveiro**, teaching computer science courses such as web development and management.

I graduated in **Computer Science at University of Mato Grosso do Sul in 2014** and have been researching since then. I finished my Master Degree in Computer Vision which I researching several preprocessing methods such as anisotropic and isotropic diffusions to improve **Texture Classification**.  

Also worked as an **Data Science reasearcher** at University of Sao Paulo where applying analytical methodologies to create knowledge over Rare Diseases in Brazil.

Furthermore, one of my passions is information around science, technology, data science, among others. I am a content creator at <a href="[https://instagram.com/maribneiva/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mariane-neiva/?locale=en_US)">Linkedlin</a>.

Due to the 2020 pandemic, I joined a volunteer group and we daily update data of COVID-19 in Brazil and predictions using epidemiologic models at: <a href="https://ciis.fmrp.usp.br/covid19/">Portal COVID-19 Brasil</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
